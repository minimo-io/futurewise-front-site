		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e have fun experimenting with technology... We build
			real-world applications & machines.
		</p>

		<p>
			We are minimalists & efficient. We aim at building performant systems with little. We use what
			it's best, we do not reinvent wheels. No charge for it. We are <a

		<p class="text-base-content font-bold"><span>//</span> We design, we experiment, we ship!</p>

		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e are also a platform for developing Digital Products. We
			offer our infrastructure, APIs and libraries to experimental projects.
		</p>

		<p>
			Some experiments fail, do not reach the level of products, so they remain as acquired
			knowledge in the form of <a href={AppConfig.fw.socials.npm}>libraries</a>, designs, and
			<a href="/blog">articles</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sometimes ideas do not leave their form, so we let them mature in the <a

			>.

			<span class="fw-text-pixel">F</span>ortunately our base tech stack is very simple yet
			powerful:
			<a href="/">Svelte</a>
			&
			<a href="/">Figma</a>
			for the front-end, <a href="/">NestJS</a> for our APIs,
			<a href="/">Python</a> for AI & <a href="/">MicroPython</a> for embedded systems, and
			<a href="/">Docker</a>
			for containerization,
			<a href="/">Bitcoin</a> & <a href="/">USDT</a> for value preservation & money transmission,
			<a href="/">Vercel</a>,<a href="/">Render</a> &
			<a href="/">AWS</a> for cloud infrastructure.

		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e believe in permission-less, global, open protocols
			(TCP/IP, HTTP, Bitcoin, Nostr, WebRTC, etc) and technologies.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sometimes we use our expertise to contribute to other projects. In these Joint Ventures we
			participate as technological partners, providing our infrastructure, APIs & our team.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e first solve our own problems through technology, and
			then make valuable products out of it.
		</p>

		<p>
			We also curate a list of third party Tools that we ourselves use on a daily basis, aiming to
			share with others not only our own stuff, but what it's best out there.
		</p>

		<p>
			We nurse from open-source, so we contribute to open-source. Many of the libraries we create
			for our products can be found in our <a
				href={AppConfig.fw.socials.github}
				class="underline hover:opacity-50">GitHub</a
			>
			or
			<a href={AppConfig.fw.socials.npm} class="underline hover:opacity-50">NPM</a> profiles. Sometimes
			even complete projects!

			Have a crazy idea? Let's chat about it, we will love it, <a
