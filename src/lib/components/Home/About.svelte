			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e are an innovation & development lab experimenting in the
			intersection of e-Commerce, Payments, AI and Machines, with a focus in LATAM.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e have fun experimenting with technology... We build
			real-world applications & machines.
		</p>

		<p>
			We are minimalists & efficient. We aim at building performant systems with little. We use what
			it's best, we do not reinvent wheels. No charge for it. We are <span

		</p>

		<p class="font-bold"><span>//</span> We design, we experiment, we ship!</p>

		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e are also a platform for developing Digital Products. We
			offer our infrastructure, APIs and libraries to experimental projects.
		</p>

		<p>
			Some experiments fail, do not reach the level of products, so they remain as acquired
			knowledge in the form of libraries, designs, and articles.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sometimes ideas do not leave their form, so we let them mature in the <a
				href="/"
				class="underline">Idea Lab</a
			>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">F</span>ortunately our base tech stack is very simple yet
			powerful:
			<span class="font-bold">Svelte</span>
			&
			<span class="font-bold">Figma</span>
			for the front-end, <span class="font-bold">NestJS</span> for our APIs,
			<span class="font-bold">Python</span> for AI & <span class="font-bold">MicroPython</span> for
			embedded systems, and <span class="font-bold">Docker</span> for containerization,
			<span class="font-bold">Bitcoin</span> & <span class="font-bold">USDT</span> for value
			preservation & money transmission,
			<span class="font-bold">Vercel</span>, <span class="font-bold">Render</span> &
			<span class="font-bold">AWS</span> for cloud infrastructure.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e believe in open-protocols, so we are also experimenting
			on building for <span class="font-bold">Nostr</span>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sometimes we use our expertise to contribute to other projects. In these Joint Ventures we
			participate as technological partners, providing our infrastructure, APIs & our team.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="fw-text-pixel">W</span>e first solve our own problems through technology, and
			then make valuable products out of it.
		</p>

		<p>
			We also curate a list of third party Tools that we ourselves use on a daily basis, aiming to
			share with others not only our own stuff, but what it's best out there.
		</p>

		<p>
			We nurse from open-source, so we contribute to open-source. Many of the libraries we create
			for our products can be found in our <span class="text-primary text-lg font-bold"
				><a href="/" class="underline hover:opacity-50">GitHub profile</a></span
			>. Sometimes even complete projects!
		</p>

		<p>
			Have a crazy idea? Let's chat about it, we will love it, <span
