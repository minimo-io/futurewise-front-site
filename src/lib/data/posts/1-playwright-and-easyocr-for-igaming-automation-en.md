title: Puppeteer & EasyOCR for Slots Automation
excerpt: This post explores how we can automate slot games using Puppeteer to control the game's interface and EasyOCR for real-time data extraction. Puppeteer acts as our programmatic "player," navigating the game, initiating spins, and interacting with elements just like a human would. Meanwhile, EasyOCR provides the critical visual intelligence, reading key information directly from the screen, such as spin results, credit balances, and bonus indicators.

This was an experiment inspired by [this John Carmack talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz9lUMSQBfY), on Upper Bound 2025, about "a robot that plays a real Atari console using a camera and a robotic joystick."

The goal of this experiment was to proove that with the appropiate AI API access it is possible to:

1. Automate the gameplay for slots games at (fun) iGaming (using [Playwright for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python)).
2. Extract jackpots, scores, and balances (using [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR).)
3. Send those captured values to an AI Ollama model for gameplay suggestions (using censored models like [gemma3n](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3n) or uncensored models at HuggingFace).
