title: Puppeteer & EasyOCR for Slots Automation
excerpt: This post explores how we can automate slot games using Puppeteer to control the game's interface and EasyOCR for real-time data extraction. Puppeteer acts as our programmatic "player," navigating the game, initiating spins, and interacting with elements just like a human would. Meanwhile, EasyOCR provides the critical visual intelligence, reading key information directly from the screen, such as spin results, credit balances, and bonus indicators.
